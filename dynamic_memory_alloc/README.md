# Dynamic Memory Allocation 

- Concept area to understand dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free` from [0x0B. C - malloc, free](../0x0B-malloc_free#resources) while trying to understand the concepts being taught.
- Read this [post](https://www.notion.so/C-Programming-f13cdb9661db464f8ea326c5a2654e8e) on `malloc and free` to understand more with examples.
	- Below are C example programs from the above post.

## Programs

- [Cool](./cool.c) Example 1. 
	- Compile this way: `gcc cool.c -o cool`
- [Number](./number.c) Exercise 1.
	- Compile this way: `gcc number.c -o number`
- [Create String](./string.c) Exercise 2.
	- Compile this way: `gcc string.c -o string`
- [Free cool](./free_cool.c).
	- Compile this way: `gcc free_cool.c -o freecool`
- [Free number](./free_number.c).
	- Compile this way: `gcc free_number.c -o freenumber`
